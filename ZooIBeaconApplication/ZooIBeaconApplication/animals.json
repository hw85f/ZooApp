  "content2" : "Bears, while often depicted in groups, are typically solitary animals. They tend to be active during the night or twilight and do much of their hunting and activity then. Bears possess an excellent sense of smell, and despite their large build, are adept runners, climbers, and swimmers.",
  "content3" : "You will often find bears in their dens, hidden in caves and burrows. During the winters, bears fall into a long period of sleep that resembles hibernation for up to 100 days! This allows the bears to work on the metabolic process and adjust their bodies to the changing environments.",

There are several other differences between the two--see if you can spot them!",
